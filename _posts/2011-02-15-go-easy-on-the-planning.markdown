title: Go Easy on the Planning

Over the years I've made quite a few attempts at making GTD work for me, but it has always failed. It's the *over-planning* that makes my mind resist the system. I hate planning.

David Allen says any outcome requiring more than one action step is a project. This sounds fine---obvious, even---on a theoretical level, but in reality this made my head hurt. Exactly in how much detail are you supposed to plan? 

I used to try to map out my projects in advance, finding the next few actions required to move it forward. When the time came to actually *do* the work I always ended up doing *something else*, rather than the actions on my list. It was only when I was about to start working that all the requirements, circumstances, strategies and priorities became clear to me. I never could foresee all those subtle nuances of myself or the world around me, while doing weekly reviews on my chamber---or on my couch, with children jumping around me. It just wasn't worth investing the time and energy.

I think I've found a better way to deal with outcomes that require multiple action steps---a way that leverages intuition and imagination. The human mind is so much more than logical deduction and it should all come into play when we conduct our lives.

These days I write my reminders on a list without worrying to much about if it's a single action or a project, if it has the correct "verb form" or any of the other productivity porn that went rampant when GTD suddenly was everywhere. When I feel like working on something I decide what to do on the spot and then go about actually doing it. When I feel like I'm finished for the day I cross the item out. If the projects isn't finished I re-enter it at the end of my list, where it stays until I feel like continuing working on it.

Don't worry about planning and trust your ability to make a sound decision on what to do when it's time to do it. You won't *really* know until then anyway. Also, do little and do it often. This I learned from [Mark Forster](http://markforster.net).

title: Why I&#8217;m Glad I Didn&#8217;t Wait for iPad 2

The last few days have been busy with opinions on the new iPad 2. I watched Engadget's live stream as Steve Jobs demoed the device on stage and was actually a bit nervous. I was afraid I would feel I made a mistake buying the first iPad only a few months before.

iPad 1 was *finally* released in Sweden towards the end of 2010. I had decided to wait for version 2, since it's generally a prudent idea to wait out the first iteration of new hardware. However, last November the therapist I'm seeing as a part of my training in psychiatry gave me an assignment, being trained in CBT and all. She wanted me to buy an iPad[^1].

So I got one and it was magical.

I've been using if for reading, surfing, emailing, twittering and---much to my surprise---for composing text. I've found [iA Writer][1] in landscape mode an excellent text editor---even when typing on glass.

When I last had to write a scientific paper I had hundreds of printed papers laying around in heaps. Now I keep everything in [Mekentosj's Papers][2] and read them on the screen. It's good for the environment and it's good for my marriage.

The one thing that bugged me about the iPad---being an iPhone 4 owner---was the screen resolution. My worst fear was that iPad 2 was to ship with a retina screen. Applied physics made this unlikely, but I was still relieved when it was official.

While the iPad 2 looks really nice, while I would really like more memory and a thinner device, I'm glad I didn't wait for it. Apple has a history of releasing *major* upgrades every other year. This means my two-year upgrade cycle now is sync. When Apple brings out the big guns in 2012 I'll be ready. Perhaps we'll se the retina screen then.

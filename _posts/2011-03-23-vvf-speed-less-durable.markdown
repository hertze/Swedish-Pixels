To my dismay I've almost worn through my [Vibram Fivefingers Speed][1] at the second toe of my right foot, after having run no more than 600 kilometres in them. I obviously do some funny business with that foot, instead of lifting my it properly from the ground. Still, I never had this issue with my [Sprints][2], which leads me to believe that the soles of the Speeds (as well as the Bikilas) are not as durable as the original rubber compound. This annoys me no end.

In an attempts to make my Speeds last this season I'm planning to mix in a lot of running in my old Sprints. I ran 10 kilometres in them yesterday and was taken aback by the different feel. The thinner sole instantly improved my technique, without any conscious effort on my part. The body took care of it on its own. However, the strap closing of my Speeds are not as comfortable and I felt the old familiar pressure areas, which leads to blistering if I'm not careful. The shoe giveth and taketh away. It was a harder workout for my feet, that's for sure.

This makes me think twice about reinvesting in Vibram's newer models, since most of them have the Speed-type sole, or a thicker trek-sole. I wish they would simply make a lace up model of the [original KSO][3].

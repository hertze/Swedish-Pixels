A while ago Merlin Mann, of [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com/) fame, stopped preaching the GTD gospel and I recently heard him (on a podcast I can't remember the name of) admitting that he didn't do *weekly reviews* anymore. This morning I read [a post by Leo Babuta](http://zenhabits.net/no-goal/), of *zenhabits*, where he describes a life without goals and action lists.

GTD, you've had a good run, but now you're going *down*. The world is changing.

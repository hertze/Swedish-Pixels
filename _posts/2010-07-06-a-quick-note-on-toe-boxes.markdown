title: A Quick Note on Toe Boxes

I've been running and walking in [Vibram Fivefingers](http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/) for almost exactly a year now. I've endured a fair amount of ridicule on account of the gecko-like design, with separate toe pockets. No one looks me in the eyes when I run past them--they all stare at my feet.

A few days ago I tried on my old [Asics Piranha](http://www.asicsamerica.com/products/product.aspx?PRODUCT_ID=240010985&TITLE_CATEGORY_ID=250001617), my last pair of traditional trainers. I ran regularly in those for over a year. Now I find I cannot wear them without having mild discomfort, or flat-out pain, from my toes being cramped together in the toe box.

There is a point in letting your toes roam free. The price you pay is undesired attention--and possibly pain when you wear regular shoes. I mostly think the price is worth it.

Today I realized the email address provided in the footer of this site wasn't working, and probably hasn't been for quite some time. I don't really know what went wrong and rather than troubleshooting the issue with my web host I moved the domain to Google Apps this evening. Everything seems to be up and running once more.

If you tried to contact me using this email address and haven't received a response, I do apologize.

I've been running exclusively in Vibram Fivefingers for more then a year and I now average 36 km (22.4 miles) a week. I've done most of this running in the Sprint model, but last month Vibram released a new model, [*Speed*][1], in Europe.[^1]

Today, I've used the Speed enough to have an opinion.

Speed is Vibrams first shoe marketed as a *running shoe*. It's built somewhat differently compared to previous models. I'm not particularily interested in the technical details, only in how that difference *feels*.

The sole is noticeably stiffer, when compared to the Sprint, and a bit thicker. This results in *less* proprioception--most evident when running on gravel, or other un-even surfaces. I mostly run on asphalt, and the feeling is a bit more numb. It's easier to get sloppy and start slamming your feet into the ground, since the Speed is more forgiving. Your brain seeks safe footing and the more padding you add under your soles the harder you ram your feet into the ground. The up-side to this new platform is of course better protection of your soles. I can run longer--a lot longer--without getting that burning sensation under my feet.

The upper part of the shoe is superb. It's no coincidence most running shoes uses lacing--it's easy to make the fit *just right* and there are no pressure areas, as in models with straps. I ran 21 km without breaking them in and I had no hot spots or blisters. The Speed is machine-washable. An important point.

All in all I find the Vibram Fivefingers Speed an excellent shoe. Personally, I probably have to mix in runs in my Sprints, or barefoot, to practice my form. The Speeds do spoil you.

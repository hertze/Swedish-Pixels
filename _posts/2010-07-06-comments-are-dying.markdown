title: Comments are dying

I decided to remove comments from Swedish Pixels for the foreseeable future. Having a website in Swedish, about obscure topics such as running, life style design and other miscellany never attracted that much discussion anyway.

John Gruber recently had to--once more--[defend his decision to not offer comments on Daring Fireball][1]. He claims they don't fit with the vision he has for his site. Venerable gentlemen of the internet, such as [John Hicks][3], [Derek Powazek][2] and [Shawn Blanc][4] joined the discussion. They explained how omitting comments changes the tone of a website and makes it a more personal outlet. Hicks also points to the reality of pestering spam comments, an ever growing irritation.

I find *allowing* comments makes me *want* comments, which makes me *write to attract* comments. That never ends well. Back in 2004, when a predecessor of Swedish Pixels was born, I much too often wrote inflammatory posts on controversial subjects, just to make visitors respond. I blush when I think about it.

However, the most important reason for my flipping the comment switch in Wordpress is the way consumption of the internet has changed.

I rarely fill out comment forms myself. While I'm sure my laziness has something to do with it the main reason is that I almost never read content on the website itself. Instead I use my RSS-reader, or [Instapaper][5]. Traditional blog comments are tied to the website, which makes them invisible to me. Syndication feeds, stripped-down reading services and even the Reader-function in Apple Safari 5 illustrates the growing division of contents from presentation. Nowadays producers of the web have very little control of how their content of viewed.

I believe the tradition blog comment is dying. It's easier than ever to publish on the web, be it on your own blog, [tumblog][6], or on Twitter. You might just as well respond to a website there, making the internet a richer place for as all. The trackback, or pingback, would be a nice way to tie the discussion together, hadn't it been for the absurd attractiveness to spam-bots. I'm sure someone will think of something new, something better.

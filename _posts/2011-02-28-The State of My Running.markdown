title: The State of My Running
layout: post

I haven't written much about running lately--mostly because I had little of substance to add to the subject. Instead I've been *practicing* running.

During the long dark Swedish winter I've logged an average of thirty kilometres a week. I've had a few discomforts, but no show-stopping injuries for at least a year. I thought I might share some of the small things I've learned out there, in the icy winds and the rain.

## Technique ##

In the beginning I tried to embrace the Pose method of running, but now I only try to listen to my body. I make an effort to maintain a proper posture and to keep my cadence around 180 steps per minute, something that doesn't come natural to me. I do my best to make my movements fluid, smoothing out all edges. Above all I try to relax---to let go of all unnecessary tension. This is the most important lesson in running, as in life itself. It's also the toughest lesson to master.

## Music ##

When I was younger I always listened to music while running. It was a way to distract myself from the pain and drudgery. When I read up on Pose, Dr. Romanov advised against music. He claimed it made it more difficult to keep the cadence high enough, since you usually fall into the same rhythm as the beat in your ears. He was probably right. This winter---after having run in silence for a year, only listening to my breathing and footfalls---I made a few experiments with my iPod and found music and running quite an excellent match. Now, I don't have any problem keeping my pace---even when listening to slow jazz.

## Shoes ##

It's been more than a year and a half since I last ran in conventional trainers. I've mostly been using Vibram Fivefingers, but last winter I ran a few months in a pair of [Feelmax Panka][2]. Shoes from Feelmax have a very thin kevlar-like sole, which I never really appreciated. Also, I have a feeling the Finnish company making them isn't doing very well business-wise. They don't seem to have launched a new collection since 2009.

My favourite running shoe by far is [VVF Speed][1]. During the cold season I've been using [VVF Trekk Flow][3], which has been nice and warm. They have an ill-placed seem at the inside of the heel, which caused some initial blistering. Nothing that couldn't be fixed with some silk tape, though.

If I were to try something new this spring I would go for a pair of [Vivobarefoot Evo][4], but I've wowed not to spend more money on running gear this year.

## Getting off the couch ##

After having worked a full day, picked up the kids from daycare, cooked dinner and and waited for the food to settle, then it's a real challenge to gear up and head out into the dark, damp cold. I would never be able to do this again and again if I wasn't physiologically and psychologically addicted to the warm feeling I get *after* a run. For a few hours it feels like the world is going to be alright. It's amazing.

On a side note: I've found it impossible to predict how a run will be based on how I feel before it. Sometimes I'm so tired I'm sure it will be hell, but then it turns out to be on of those runs where I feel more alive, invincible and able to go on forever. I call those "God runs". About one in four is a God run. They are the reason I put up with the rest.
